# Create a Game-HW 6

We all need to collaborate on creating a game. Post suggestions and/or pictures :)

We are not writing the code and creating an actual game. We are simply developing the idea. What it will look like, who is the main character, what is the objective, etc.


From Michelle and Cristina:
Game Idea #1: Dr. Dog - for ages 8+. A game where children can be veterinarians. Working to diagnose medical problems with different animals, learning about different species, breeds of dogs/cats, and taking steps to heal injured or sick animals.

(Doesn't have to be called Dr. Dog, that's just what I had in my head)


Game Idea #2: Architecture game. Building different structures in different styles of architecture (Gothic, Deco, Modern, etc.)


Game Idea #3: Tetris-like puzzle game.


Game Idea #4: Some kind of travel game where you get to learn different trivia about the people who live in different parts of the world, the interesting sites, foods, history, etc.


Game Idea #5: Geography game for kids. Learning shapes and angles.
